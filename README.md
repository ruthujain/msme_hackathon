Hackathon Problem Statement: Building a Blockchain-Driven Trade Finance Ecosystem for MSMEs

Context
The global trade finance ecosystem, particularly for MSMEs in India, is plagued by inefficiencies that limit their growth and competitiveness in international markets. Despite MSMEs accounting for nearly 50% of Indiaâ€™s exports, they face several critical challenges:
Fragmented Trade and Logistics Data:


Manual and paper-intensive workflows lead to delays in trade documentation and logistics tracking.
Absence of centralized platforms, such as a Logistics Data Bank, makes it difficult to verify shipment progress and coordinate between exporters, banks, and customs.
Compliance Complexities:


Trade finance processes require adherence to complex regulations like UCP (Uniform Custom and Practice for Documentary Credit), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), and HSN classification rules.
Errors in Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) codes for product classification often delay customs clearance and lead to penalties.
Inefficient Fund Flow and Liquidity Constraints:


Delays in invoice processing and payments impact cash flow, leaving MSMEs unable to scale operations.
MSMEs struggle to access working capital due to the time-intensive nature of securing trade finance and verifying compliance.
Fraud and Risk Management:


High risk of fraud in document handling, fund flow, and shipment updates due to reliance on manual processes.
No robust mechanism exists to validate the authenticity of trade documents like Letters of Credit (LCs), Bills of Lading, or payment receipts.
